# GISR
Exploratory Project on Guided Image Super-Resolution and Reconstruction for the Autumn 2020 IFT6150 Image Processing course at Université de Montréal.

Explores the use of the guided filter [Kaiming He et al., ECCV2010](http://kaiminghe.com/eccv10/index.html) for image super-resolution and reconstruction. Providing a single high-quality guide image significantly improves results for denoising, deblurring and super-resolution.
